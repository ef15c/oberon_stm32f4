SDIO Config

PCLK2 = 84MHz
SDIOCLK = 48MHz
CLKDIV = 0
SDIO_CK = SDIOCLK / [CLKDIV + 2] = 48 / 2 = 24MHz

From reference manual:
"PCLK2 and SDIO_CK clock frequencies must respect the following condition:
PCLK2 >= 3 / 8 x SDIO_CK"

84 >= (3/8*24 = 3*24/8 = 9) OK

From device errata sheet:
In case there is an ongoing data transfer from the SDIO host to the SD card and the hardware flow control is
disabled (bit 14 of the SDIO_CLKCR is not set), if an underrun condition occurs, the controller may transmit
a corrupted data block (with a wrong data word) without detecting the underrun condition when the clock
frequencies have the following relationship:
 3 x period(PCLK2) + 3 x period(SDIOCLK) >= 32 / BusWidth x period(SDIO_CK)

(0,0357142857143 + 0,0625 = 0,0982142857143) >= (32 / 4 x 1/24 = 0,333333333333) OK
