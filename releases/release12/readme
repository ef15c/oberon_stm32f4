Oberon STM32F429I-DISCO station release 12
------------------------------------------
18/04/2025

**WARNING**: the bootloader has changed since release 11 to support execution
of modules in embedded flash memory. Don't forget to update the bootloader
if you upgrade the system form a previous release.

Installation
------------

Install firmware BootLoad.hex on the STM32F429I-DISCO board.
See STMicroelectronics documentation to know how to do that.

Copy the oberon filesystem on the SD Card. Under Linux, execute:
sudo dd if=rel12_oberon_stm32.partition of=/dev/<your sd card> bs=1024 seek=262145 status=progress

Install the SD card in the base board, connect the keyboard, the mouse and the VGA monitor.
Finally, power up the STM32F429I-DISCO board.

To use the Oberon system and compiler in embedded flash memory:
1/ boot the system while pressing the SW1 button for entering flash update mode
2/ execute the command OM4L.LoadEF OM4P.efb
3/ reboot the system without pressing the SW1 button
 
Enjoy Oberon!
