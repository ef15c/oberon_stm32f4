Object code V3 file format:
      CodeFile = name key version imports sections entries "O".
      imports  = {name key} 0X.
      sections = {segment name size content fixups} 0X.
      segment  = "c" | "d" | "s" | "v" | "r".
      content  = {byte}.

      entries  = nof {sno}.

      name: string containing the module or object name
      key: CRC32 hash of the modules's symbol file
      version: 0: legacy mode, 1: legacy RAM execution mode,
               2, 3: not used, reserved for future use
               4: sections mode, 5: sections RAM execution mode*)

      sections: describes block of data or code that can be omitted by
        the linker if they are not referenced. Each block will correspond
        with a global object (variable, stored const or procedure).
        
        segment: "c" for code in flash memory,
                 "d" for data in flash memory,
                 "s" for strings in flash memory,
                 "v" for vectors table or
                 "r" for variables in RAM.
        size: size in bytes of the segment
        content: the code or data for flash memory segment.
          It is empty for RAM segment.
          
        fixups: these are backward linked list of referenced sections.
          The linker will walk them to resolve static addresses.
          
          fixadr: the address of the most recent reference to a section.
            the value at this address contains the next reference. The
            value 0 marks the end of the list.
          mno: the nodule index in the import array. The value 0 means
            the current module. Others values is the rank of the
            imported module.
          sno: is the section index in the mno indexed module.
          offset: is the offset in byte of the referenced data.
      
          the vectors table is a particular type of section flagged
          with "v" segment. It appears exactly once as the last section
          in the object file.
      
      nof: number of items
      sno: section index starting from 0.
      
      entries: exported objects. The first one is the section index of
        the initialization code of the module.
